1.5-8:

o Added a subset method for the "lp" class to resolve the problem that in a locfit()
  call, if "subset" is given then any optional argument to lp() are ignored.

1.5-7:

o Patches by Brian Ripley (added NAMESPACE, changed Call_S(), etc.)

1.5-6:

o Added check for 0-row data so locfit() won't segfault.


1.5-5:

o Patches provided by Brian Ripley to clean up some function arguments and
  documentations.
